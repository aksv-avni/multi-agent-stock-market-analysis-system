# Multi-agent Stock-Market Analyst
I created a Multi-agent Stock-Market
Analysis system which involves 3 agents
working together to provide information and
Analysis on the Stock Data. It researches the
trends, performs an analysis and provides a
suggestion for stock investment specifically
for technology related stocks. The main files
in the code are : agents.yaml, tasks.yaml,
crew.py, main.py
