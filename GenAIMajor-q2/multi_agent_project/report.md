**Investment Suggestion:**

Based on the current analysis (late October 2024), **Microsoft (MSFT) appears to be the most attractive investment option among the three.**  Its strong growth in cloud computing, coupled with its strategic AI investments, suggests higher growth potential compared to Amazon and Infosys.
